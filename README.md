# Palindrome-Birthday-Checker
My girlfriend and I are almost 9 years apart.
She turned 23 this year, I am going to turn 32.
I wondered how many of there "palindrome" birthdays we were going to have.
Sure you could calculate that on your fingers.
Or do a quick spreadsheet. 
That is not why we code though.
